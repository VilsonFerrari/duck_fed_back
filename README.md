# Fed the Duck - Back

## Database

The application was built using [Knex.JS](http://knexjs.org/) as Query Builder.

You can use `yarn migrate:full` to migrate and seed the database.

You can also change the Query Builder since the project is using abstraction.


## Init

You can start by with the command `yarn start`.
